# LSTM
'''Trains an LSTM model on the IMDB sentiment classification task.

The dataset is actually too small for LSTM to be of any advantage
compared to simpler, much faster methods such as TF-IDF + LogReg.

# Notes

- RNNs are tricky. Choice of batch size is important,
choice of loss and optimizer is critical, etc.
Some configurations won't converge.

- LSTM loss decrease patterns during training can be quite different
from what you see with CNNs/MLPs/etc.
